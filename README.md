# CRM and Note Taking in Excel (XLSM)

A **customizable CRM and note tracking** Excel file with automation features using **VBA** and **VLOOKUP**.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Dataset

### Context
In small and medium-sized firms that aim to implement **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**, employees sometimes use **Excel** to track customer feedback.

While Excel is widely used due to its **popularity and clean interface**, it is not as advanced as dedicated CRM software like **Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, or Zoho**. However, Excel remains a good choice when an organization wants to collect **lower-level feedback** before uploading it to a more advanced CRM system.

To make **CRM tracking in Excel** more efficient, I researched how a **CRM officer, salesperson, or data manager** can automate client feedback tracking using **Excel VBA and VLOOKUP**.

## ðŸ“‚ Content

This dataset contains a single file:
- **CRM Finance Loan Tracking Excel File.xlsm**

### How to Use the Excel File:
First, **enable macros** in the Excel file. Then, you can proceed as follows:
On the first sheet called **CLIENT LOANS**, try typing in column M (Current Note) for any client. The **VBA code** will automatically update the **1st to 5th Latest Notes** in columns N to R.
You can look the note logs in the second sheet called **LogSheet**.
The third sheet called **CountSpecific** shows the count of specific notes for each client.

Note that you can tweak the functionality of these XLSM files to suit your needs, by removing some unneeded columns and adding new ones. Just remember to modify the VBA code accordingly.

### Columns Included:
- **Client**
- **Bank Branch Name**
- **Phone Number**
- **Client Account No.**
- **Loan Account No.**
- **Product**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Disbursed Date**
- **Maturity Date**
- **Repaid Amount**
- **Debt Owing**
- **Current Note**
- **1st Latest Note**
- **2nd Latest Note**
- **3rd Latest Note**
- **4th Latest Note**
- **5th Latest Note**

## ðŸŽ“ Acknowledgements
This dataset includes **random client names** generated from [1000 Random Names](https://1000randomnames.com/). Other columns contain **randomized client data**. Sample notes for five clients have been manually added for **illustrative purposes**.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration
- Can we create a **simple Excel file** for tracking client feedback?
- Can **Excel formulas** help in identifying **recurring customer complaints**?
- Can we make it easier to **view previous client feedback**?
